# Folder-Password-Protector
This allows you to lock/unlock folders using a password. Very helpful application IMO. Please favorite/like if you think this is a good application!

The password is stored in: Appdata\Roaming\LockingApp\Password.txt
I wouldn't reccomend locking that folder as it may prevent the program from being able to access it. Might not though.
(wasn't willing to risk having an infinitely locked file on my computer during debugging)
